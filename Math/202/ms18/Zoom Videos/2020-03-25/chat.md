14:27:51	 From  Arya : Sir I did not get what is that cross product
14:28:49	 From  Himanshu Tiwari : unmute yourself and ask
14:30:14	 From  Dhruva Sambrani : Isn't that just Ex \CROSS Ey?
14:34:40	 From  G.C.Nightwalker : someone can write on ur screen?
14:38:41	 From  Atharva Deshpande : Sir, are you considering getting a writing input for your Mac? Reading maths isn't helping when learning the concepts for the first time.
14:38:49	 From  Atharva Deshpande : It would be like boardwork
14:45:10	 From  G.C.Nightwalker : basically fx is partial differential of probablity
14:45:22	 From  G.C.Nightwalker : am I ryt?
14:49:21	 From  Dhruva Sambrani : But r and theta are independant?
14:49:30	 From  Aniket  : yes
14:50:08	 From  Aniket  : I guess this is not the same independent as in the English literature
14:50:56	 From  Dhananjay Joshi : r and theta have limits indipendent of each other so yes
14:51:42	 From  G.C.Nightwalker : no sir more than one person
14:53:22	 From  Dhruva Sambrani : Then given any 2 non independent RVs, can one always find a combination of them that are independent? Seems very similar to finding an orthogonal basis for a set of vectors. Are they related?
14:54:11	 From  Aalhad Bhatt : I don't think so
14:54:29	 From  Aalhad Bhatt : There needs to be some symmetry for that
14:55:14	 From  Aalhad Bhatt : With the circle, it's radial symmetry
14:58:07	 From  Aalhad Bhatt : Actully, strike what I said, I don't know
14:58:27	 From  Dhananjay Joshi : I knew this was coming
14:58:33	 From  Dhananjay Joshi : :)
15:03:04	 From  Tejprakash Sharma : from converting x and y to r and theta will the probability density function change??
15:03:25	 From  Dhananjay Joshi : yes it will
15:03:41	 From  Dhananjay Joshi : it will be 2 pi r something
15:03:44	 From  Smriti Chhibber : In the case of shapes is writing parametric coordinates same as saying that we are talking about independent variables?
15:03:49	 From  Dhananjay Joshi : it will be like rectange
15:05:48	 From  Aalhad Bhatt : What rabbithole have you lead us down Dhruva
15:08:53	 From  Tejprakash Sharma : yesssss
15:09:07	 From  Shivali Sinhmar : yesss
15:09:10	 From  Yashvi ms18150 : yesss
15:09:54	 From  G.C.Nightwalker : ðŸ¥¶ðŸ˜±4GB!!!!!!!
15:10:01	 From  Aditya Pawan : isn't it 206 people?
