# IISER-M Course files
This is a website which hosts all the files for the courses.
Presently, we aim to put up the files atleast for the Core courses.

# No books will be uploaded here, nor linked.

This is a copyright infringement. Search for sources with-in the campus. The library is what I mean :wink:.

Add files in the right place, then run `make_index.py -I -g -n Home` to build the index. Make sure everything looks ok, and commit and PR
